A blog is born. Just what the world needed.

This is my blog.

It's hosted by [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), using a template called [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), that was modified by [Joshua Lande](https://github.com/joshualande/joshualande.github.io). 

So I, um, saved myself a bit of work.
