I never understood what people meant when they described a fabric that moves with you. After [these shorts](http://mylesapparel.com) I do, but I'm not sure I can describe it.

When you squat in the gym, the "four-way stretch" fabric comes along for the ride. You feel it but then it continues moving with you. Maybe it's better described as fabric that doesn't push back?

Either way, they look good enough to be your *formal* shorts, with a plain design and no logos. Myles says you can use them as swim trunks too. I haven't tried that but they dry very quickly after being pulled out of the washing machine.

They're not cheap but I'm constantly wearing them this summer so I can justify the cost.

I like them so much pair no. 3 is in the mail.
